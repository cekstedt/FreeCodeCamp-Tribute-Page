        <p>This is the greatest and best song in the world...tribute.</p>

        <p>
          Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here,<br />
          We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.<br />
          All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon<br />
          In the middle of the road,<br />
          And he said,
          <q
            >Play the best song in the world<br />
            Or I'll eat your soul.</q
          ><br />
          Well, me and Kyle, we looked at each other<br />
          And we each said, <q>Okay</q><br />
          And we played the first thing that came to our heads, just so happened
          to be<br />
          The best song in the world, it was the best song in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Look into my eyes and it's easy to see<br />
          One and one make two, two and one make three.<br />
          It was destiny.<br />
          Once every hundred-thousand years or so,<br />
          When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow<br />
          And the grass doth grow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Needless to say, the beast was stunned.<br />
          A whip-crack went his whippy tail and the beast was done.<br />
          He asked us, <q>Be you angels?</q><br />
          And we said, <q>Nay, we are but men!</q> Rock!
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not the greatest song in the world, no,<br />
          This is just a tribute.<br />
          Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no,<br />
          No, this is a tribute<br />
          To the greatest song in the world, alright!<br />
          It was the greatest song in the world, alright!<br />
          Yeah, it was the best motherfuckin' song,<br />
          The greatest song in the world!
        </p>

        <p>
          And the peculiar thing is this, my friends,<br />
          The song we sang on that fateful night,<br />
          It didn't actually sound anything like this song.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is just a tribute. You've gotta believe me.<br />
          And I wish you were there, just a matter of opinion.<br />
          Ah, fuck! Good God! Gotta love it!<br />
          So surprised to find you can't stop it!<br />
          A fiery ring of fire! Rich motherfucker!
        </p>
